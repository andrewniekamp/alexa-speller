# Spelling Thing

## API

Currently using Pearson
Example: [Pearson](http://api.pearson.com/v2/dictionaries/entries?headword=test)

However, this one is deprecated and will be gone by the end of the year.
It is free and didn't require signup, I'm waiting on Macmillan's API key registration to complete.
Will need to update tests for the new API definitions, as they will likely differ.
